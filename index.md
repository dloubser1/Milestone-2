## Part A

### The Problem of Study

With the drastic increase in online and hybrid asynchronous learning students have issues staying focused on what is going on in their classes and are struggling to keep up with the material. 

While a user’s goal may be to learn class content by simply logging in to a call, actually performing the action of listening in is made difficult by the various distractions available through available electronic devices.

### How Is This Relevant?

This problem is relevant to the theme of hybrid synchronous learning because students are susceptible to distractions outside of an official classroom environment. It can be argued that it is much easier for students to distract themselves with cell phones, class-unrelated web-browsing, and/or computer games without professors or TA’s holding students accountable. 

Furthermore, students are less likely to engage in such behaviors in an official classroom, as their actions can potentially distract other students as well. ([Citation 2](dloubser1.github.io/Milestone-2#works-cited)) 

However, when a student is at home, their actions are much less likely to directly affect their peers, so they are less likely to think twice about engaging in such actions. Students in a classroom setting are more likely to focus on the material because possible distractions such as cell phone usage can be prohibited by the instructor. 
However, when not in an official classroom or lecture hall, it is much easier for students to turn to such devices and disconnect from learning, which can potentially hinder their ability to absorb and process vital lesson material.

### Scenarios Based on The Seven Stages of Action

GOAL: I want to learn.

PLAN: I should remove any distractions.

SPECIFY: I could possibly remove my cell phone from my environment.

PERFORM: I mute notification sounds, but I do not move it to another room.

PERCEIVE: I cannot hear or see notifications from my cell phone during lecture, but I can physically interact with my phone if I am tempted to.

INTERPRET: The fact that I can only hear my instructor and my peers means my cell phone isn’t distracting me, but because it is still near me I can choose to pick it up and use it during lecture.

COMPARE: Because I had the option to interact with my cellphone, I might have stopped paying attention during the lecture.

The example in this scenario, the cell phone, can be replaced by other sources of distractions such as unrelated web-browsing (ie. Netflix, social media) or usage of unrelated apps and programs (ie. gaming).

### Is This Typical?

This is typical of students that choose to participate online-only. A survey conducted by Barnes and Noble Education in 2020 found that 64% of students surveyed were concerned about being unable to focus in settings that were not traditional classroom environments. (Business Wire, 2020) 

We can admit that all five of us have done this before, and asking other students elicits similar admittances as well. The use of a cell phone is just one possible distraction of many. Students may also be tempted to browse the web, view movies in a separate tab, play online games, or just leave the room altogether.

### The People Affected

The user population most affected by our problem is composed of students attending class virtually in an environment that differs from a classroom setting, which typically involves a number of potential distractions traditionally absent from a classroom.

### The Tasks The People Do

Our problem includes the following tasks:

* Attending class through logging in / joining an online call

* Paying attention in class and participating in interactive segments of class (i.e. answering questions or responding to polls)

* Taking notes on relevant material covered by the teacher

* Asking questions about the material if clarification is required

### How Would The People Benefit?

Users would benefit through a solution by ensuring greater participation and focus from a majority of the class, comparable to how a student would focus and learn in a classroom setting. Greater comprehension of material as well as greater retention of content, and therefore a better learning experience.

## Part B

### What Solutions Exist

Existing solutions include: 

* Zoom Whiteboard. Zoom has a feature called Whiteboard that is what it sounds like; it’s a virtual whiteboard that the teacher and students can write on. High school and college professors use it to keep their students engaged. 

  - Pros: this allows students and teachers to interact in real time. If students have not been given permission to write on it, it is still a good way to keep students attention since it is familiar to a classroom setting.
  
  - Cons: some students are not as emotionally mature as others and could write vulgar/obscene things on the whiteboard for everyone to see.
  
* Zoom Polling. Zoom has a functionality that allows for teachers to poll/quiz their students in a meeting.

  - Pros: Students will be more engaged if they are being asked questions throughout class. This can also give teachers a gauge on how many students are consistently paying attention.
  
  - Cons:  I do not believe there is a functionality to easily upload the results of the polls/quizzes to websites/other apps, so if a teacher is doing this for a grade, it can be frustrating. 
  
* Games. This has been more in K-12, but teachers have been using games to keep their students engaged. They’ve ranged from things like Kahoot to internet scavenger hunts.

  - Pros: Trivia games have been shown to keep brains engaged and it can be a fun thing to lighten students’ moods during the ongoing pandemic.

  - Cons: Some college professors may find it childish

### What Guidelines and Principles Do These Follow?

## Part C

### Our Proposed Solution

Our design solution is an app that allows for a shared note taking system between student and teacher. The app affords for the student to take notes in both typed and written format, while the teacher has the ability to view notes being typed and monitor the student’s participation and attention during class. 

The student is alone in their editing privilege, the teacher only being able to view the notes and the last time a change was made. The app also has the property of keeping track of the average amount of time since the last edit for the whole class. 

If any one student’s time of last edit becomes too egregious, the teacher is notified of their lack of activity. In the teacher’s view, a student’s name would become highlighted in orange, signifying their deviation from the rest of the class’s activities.

#### Those That Are Similar

There exist solutions similar to this, such as the Zoom Whiteboard, but they fail to individualize the experience for every student. The Whiteboard is shared between the whole meeting (or breakout room), and the teacher is unable to monitor it if they are not in that specific room. Our proposal allows for the teacher to have viewing access to each student’s notes or work on an activity, while the students are able to securely take notes and show their participation in class without verbal or visual actions.

A shared note-taker application or add-on for Zoom available to individual students and teachers. Students are able to edit their notes, adding images, drawing, inserting handwriting, or just inserting text. Teachers are able to view the page a student is editing, watching their participation in real time.

This is essentially an expansion upon the Zoom Whiteboard feature, that individualizes the experience to a relationship between student and teacher.

### How Will We Measure Success

The design will be a success if students are able to edit a document only available for editing by them and viewing by their teacher. The teacher must also be able to access that document to see how well the student is participating in class, as well as getting a notification indicating when a student significantly diverges from the rest of the class’s most recent edits.
